//      constant, permitted only outside production (or by an explicit
//      BRIEF_DEV_AUTH=1, which authStatus() then reports as insecure).
//
// What has NOT changed: no route ever reads an actor identity out of the
// request body or query string. A client-supplied `userId` is a forgeable
// claim, not an identity.
