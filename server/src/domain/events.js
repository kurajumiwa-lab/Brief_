// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// EVENTS HUB (Tikiti T4)
//
// One honest browsing surface over the events that actually exist: published
// campaigns (with their types as categories) + calendar entries. It creates
// NO second event table -- a category is a campaign type. Filters that match
// nothing return nothing, with counts the caller can trust.
//
// DECISION 6 (docs/DECISIONS.md) scopes this surface hard, and the scoping is
// enforced by server/test/decisions.mjs:
//   * NO featured events, NO promoted events, NO featured slot. There is no
//     `setFeatured` here and no featured filter; prominence is neither the
//     organiser's to claim nor the platform's to sell.
//   * NO social proof. No "X going", no attendee names, no registration count,
//     no view count. The only number an event surface may print is seats:
//     "27 of 40 seats remaining."
//   * Sorting is `startsAt` ascending. Period -- there is no other order.
// The rationale is the operator's: these mechanics drive FOMO, and FOMO does
// not pay the host.
//
// T4 detail model: the rich detail screen needs context that is DERIVED, never
// stored -- a host's other events, related events, and series occurrences are
// all scanned from real campaign rows on read. There is no `host` table, no
// `series` table, no `eventContext` cache. See `relatedEvents`,
// `hostEvents` and `seriesOccurrences` below.

// call: "'no attendee names' also ends the record's sparing of the per-viewer

// it costs, and how many seats are left.
