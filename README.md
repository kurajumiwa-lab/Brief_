# Brief — Economic coordination for Kenyan women, workers and micro-enterprises

**Brief is a distribution-and-economic infrastructure layer for organizations that already have trusted groups of women, workers, traders, suppliers and entrepreneurs — not a bank, and not another consumer app.**

A member requests something they source, a supplier quotes it, the two agree on
terms and run the work to completion, the completion is remembered so the same
sourcing is one tap next time, both parties build a **derived, explainable**
track record, and payment is collected and settled through real rails — with
every figure derived from real rows, never stored as a second source of truth.

---

## What Brief is, and what it is not

**The positioning.** Brief does not try to become a bigger consumer app. It is
a *distribution and economic-coordination layer* for organizations that already
hold a trusted group — women-focused banks, SACCOs, table-banking groups, coops, employers,
NGOs, KNCCI-type networks, corporate supplier-diversity programs. They bring
the cohort; Brief supplies the shop, the records, the verification and the
money rails; the ledger proves what the cohort actually did.

**Not a bank, not a lender.** Brief does not hold user funds, does not lend,
does not score credit, does not insure, and does not touch crypto. "Brief is
not a bank" is a hard constraint, not a slogan.

**Honesty is the product.** Every number the UI shows — earnings, commission,
withdrawable, trust history, partner revenue share — is **derived** by scanning
real rows. A stored total is a second source of truth waiting to disagree with
the first. When something is unavailable, Brief says so instead of fabricating
success: an unconfigured payment rail returns `503` with a reason, not a fake
"paid".

## The product surface

Production enters through `preview/src/main.jsx` → `preview/src/app/AppShell.tsx`.
The current bottom bar has **Home, Mine, You**, plus a **Create** action:

| Door | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Home** | Nearby activity and discovery. |
| **Mine** | Your shops, orders and saved items. |
| **You** | Identity, standing, money and settings. |
| **Create (+)** | Opens the creation sheet; it is not a destination. |

Requests, Supply, Partners and Pulse remain reachable through the drawer.
See `preview/src/app/Navigation.tsx` and `NavSheet.tsx` for the current routing.

## The core economic loop

One chain, all derived, all honest:

1. **Request** — a member posts structured demand (`domain/requests.js`): quantity, unit, category, budget, deadline, specs.
2. **Match** — demand is matched to participant capabilities, every match explaining itself in words (`domain/matching.js`).
3. **Quote** — the participant proposes integer-minor-unit terms; totals are BigInt-exact (`domain/quotes.js`, `quoteValidation.js`).
4. **Work order** — accepting a quote freezes an agreement and runs a two-party fulfillment state machine (`domain/workOrders.js`).
5. **Repeat procurement** — completing a work order records a repeatable pattern, so "request again" is one tap (`domain/procurement.js`).
6. **Trust** — economic history is derived per participant/capability with explainable signals, never a secret score (`domain/participantTrust.js`).
7. **Payment** — collection through KCB Buni STK push when configured; payouts remain manual and finance-confirmed. Automated Buni disbursement is blocked pending a verified transfer contract (`domain/workPayment.js`, `connectors/buni.js`).

The **supply layer** (`domain/supply.js`, `supplyVerification.js`) models
enterprises and their capabilities (production / stock / service / logistics /
sourcing access), with scoped verification records (identity, business type,
sourcing role, capability, capacity, authorization) — never an aggregate
"fully verified" badge.

---

## The distribution layer (attribution + partners)

The strategic core of the product. Two first-class domains:

**Attribution** (`domain/attribution.js`) — the provenance chain. When a member
arrives, Brief captures *once* (first-touch-wins) how they got here:

```
partner=WEF → program=women-enterprise-2026 → cohort=nairobi-west
  → invite=ABC123 → member=USER456 → work order → KES 12,500
```

Economic activity per member and per partner/cohort is **derived** from real
rows (fulfilled orders, completed work, repeat patterns) — never stored. A
partner with no members shows zero, plainly.

**Partner** (`domain/partner.js`) — first-class distribution partners. A
partner is a *stored, contracted* record (organisation → programs → cohorts)
keyed against the attribution keys. Its revenue share is a **derived
obligation** (`floor(shareRate × verifiedCommercialKes)`) that becomes money
only through a settlement that finance confirms, writing a real ledger
transaction (`partner_revenue_share`). The transparent ledger reads:

```
Partner generated KES 482,300 → Partner share KES 48,230 → Brief KES 38,584 → costs KES 9,646
```

These are operator-created records, not member claims; revenue share is a
derived number, never fabricated money.

## One economic layer

`ledgerTransactions` is the single source of economic truth. There is no
wallet, no balance column and no per-feature economy. Money is
server-authoritative: a client posting `{price: 1}` against a KES 2,500 listing
gets an order for 2,500. Settlement is refused unless a genuinely settled
ledger transaction backs it.

- **Collection:** KCB Buni STK push (`server/src/connectors/buni.js`) — fails closed when unconfigured. Configuration alone does not verify a working payment.
- **Disbursement:** manual + finance-confirmed. Buni automated transfers are deliberately refused; adding credentials does not implement payouts. Keep `SETTLEMENT_RAIL=manual`. The separate Daraja connector serves Huduma, not the core commerce payout rail.
- **Referrals** (`domain/referrals.js`): depth hard-capped at **one level**, no entry fee anywhere, points convert to cash only from a pool backed by a fixed fraction of confirmed service-fee revenue.

## Repository layout

```
preview/src/main.jsx    Production entry: AppShell, or PublicCampaignPage at /c/:slug.
preview/src/App.tsx     Legacy feature-test harness, not the production shell.
preview/src/app/        Production shell and navigation.
preview/src/features/   Modular product surfaces.
preview/src/api/        Typed client API and transport.
preview/src/model/      Client types and derivations.
server/src/connectors/  External-provider adapters.
server/src/domain/      Business rules and workflows.
server/src/routes/      Express HTTP routes.
server/src/store.js     File-backed JSON store and additive migrations.
server/test/            Server test suites.
preview/                Vite build and jsdom client suites.
tc/                     Typecheck config reading preview/src directly.
```

`preview/src/` is the single canonical client source tree — built by Vite and
read directly by the typechecker (`tc/tsconfig.json` includes
`../preview/src`). The legacy `App.tsx` shell remains only as the test harness
for the older feature suites (Circles, Marketplace, events, tickets, …); the
production entry (`preview/src/main.jsx`) renders `AppShell` and never imports
it.

## Running it

Use Node 22 LTS for the commands below (the `--env-file` option requires
Node 20.6+), and npm 9+. Run commands from the repository root.

### Install and start locally

```bash
npm ci                                  # all workspaces, from the root lockfile
cp server/.env.example server/.env.local # optional connectors; keep secrets local
node --env-file=server/.env.local server/src/index.js
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
npm run dev                             # Vite on :5173, API proxy to :8787
```

The server binds `0.0.0.0:8787` by default. Keep `PORT=8787` in the local
server env file to match Vite's `/ingest/*` proxy. Browser code uses that
relative proxy path, not a localhost backend URL.

**Environment files are not loaded by `npm start` automatically.** Use the
explicit `node --env-file=...` command above, or export variables before
starting. Node 18 users must export variables instead of using `--env-file`.
The root `.env.example` is a **deployment** template: its `/data` path needs
a mounted volume and is not the default local setup.

### Run the production build locally

```bash
npm run build:client
NODE_ENV=production node --env-file=server/.env.local server/src/index.js
```

Stop the dev backend first if it is using the same port. With variables already
exported (as on Railway), `npm start` is the equivalent production command.

No external credentials are needed for local domains. Unconfigured connectors
fail closed; they do not manufacture a delivery or payment. For optional Buni
collection, configure `BUNI_CONSUMER_KEY`, `BUNI_CONSUMER_SECRET`,
`BUNI_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `BUNI_ENV=uat`, and a real HTTPS `BRIEF_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`.
Use KCB-issued organization/passkey/till values where applicable. Before
production, obtain KCB's confirmed host and account enablement. See
[deployment setup](DEPLOYMENT.md) and the detailed
[payment integration record](docs/PAYMENTS-INTEGRATION.md).

**Automated payouts are a separate blocked workstream.** Do not set
`BUNI_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_TRANSFERS` or switch the settlement rail to an adapter
that does not exist.

---

## Tests

Run from the repo root after `npm ci`:

```bash
npm run build:client       # Vite production build (preview/src is the source)
./run-suites.sh            # client suites (jsdom)
cd server && npm test      # server suite (run.js + per-domain files)
npx tsc -p tc/tsconfig.json  # strict typecheck (expects exit 0)
```

**Historical baseline — measured 2026-09-10 (not the current release status):**

| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| Server (`cd server && npm test`, 21 suites) | **2892 passed / 0 failed / 1 skipped** |
| Client (`./run-suites.sh`) | **1861 passed / 0 failed** |
| Strict typecheck (`tc`) | exit 0 |

The server suite skips (rather than passes) network-dependent assertions when
the network is unavailable, so a green run always means something real
happened.

---

## Deployment

`railway.json` builds the client with `npm run build:client` and starts
`NODE_ENV=production node server/src/index.js`, serving the compiled frontend
from `preview/dist`. The server binds `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (default 8787) and
exposes `/api/health` and `/api/ready`.

Environment variables: server secrets must **never** carry the `VITE_` prefix —
that prefix is what exposes a value to the browser. See `.env.example` and
`server/.env.example`.

---

## Deliberately out of scope

No star ratings, no review walls, no credit scoring, no lending, no BNPL, no
insurance, no crypto, no opaque AI scoring, no M-Pesa onboarding that pretends
a payment happened. Keep Brief "not a bank".
