// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// HOW BRIEF WORKS — the one screen that carries the explanations.
//
// The rest of the app is deliberately terse: numbers, dots, one action per empty
// state. That terseness is only honest if the reasoning is still available
// somewhere a person can reach it, so every sentence that was taken out of the
// flow lives here, in one place, readable in a minute. Nothing here is new
// information; it is the same audit trail, moved out of the working surface.
//
// Why a single screen instead of a footnote on each number: a footnote you must
// read to use the product is anxiety wearing a UX costume. A page you open when
// you want to check how a figure was produced is respect for both the sceptic and
// the person in a hurry.
