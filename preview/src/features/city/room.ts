// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ROOM — one set of surfaces, one light source, shared by every screen that
// shows a picture.
//
// Why this exists: a card that carries its own ad-hoc gradient, its own
// `border: 1px solid` and its own black scrim is a card in a different room
// from its neighbours. That is what made Browse feel "nude" — flat white paper,
// grey strokes, and cold blue-violet plates that looked dropped in from
// somewhere else. So the treatment lives here and is the same everywhere:
//
//   * `roomSurface()` / `PLASTER` + `plateGlow()` — a plate for a thing with NO
//     photo: the room's own plaster, lifted by light, with the accent at about
//     11% so the brand is present without the surface becoming a gradient
//     swatch. Never a stock photo, never a pattern pretending to be a picture,
//     never a dark panel, and never more than TWO background layers: a plate
//     paints its plaster floor and its light as separate elements, which is both
//     simpler to reason about and legible to a CSSOM that chokes on long
//     background lists (jsdom — which the suites run on — drops them entirely,
//     so an over-layered plate would silently render as nothing under test).
//   * `PHOTO_SCRIM` — the ink of the room (not pure black) fading up through a
//     real photograph, so type over a photo reads and the photo reads as lit by
//     this room. `.brief-scrim` in index.css is the same gradient for class use.
//   * `PHOTO_FILTER` — the house grade on real pictures: −10% saturation,
//     +5% contrast, a breath of warmth. A photograph of a crate of tomatoes
//     is never re-coloured into something it is not; this is a grade, not a
//     disguise. Grain is deliberately absent: it needs an overlay per image,
//     and the feed does not pay for decoration.
//   * `LISTED_AGO` — the only sentence a photo-less card is allowed about time,
//     and only when the row carries a real timestamp.
//
// Nothing in here takes a colour from a hash of a title or a seller name: an
// invented hue that looks like data is the same mistake as an invented number.
