// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CATEGORY PALETTE — the colour identity of an exhibit, derived from its
// CATEGORY, not from a hash of its title.
//
// Why: the monogram letter ("W" for Wedding, "S for "Saturday brunch run") read
// as a placeholder — a letter that maps to nothing the user knows. A category
// tint does map to something: the same wing of the case is always the same
// colour, so the palette teaches the taxonomy instead of decorating it.
//
// THE ROOM REVISION (2026-09-17): a wing used to be a hard indigo→cyan FILL laid
// behind the text, which is why a card with no cover photo looked like a poster
// from another app pasted into a page of paper cards. A category colour is now a
// LIGHT on the room's own plaster (`categoryPlate`), not a fill. `categoryGradient`
// stays for the rare surface that genuinely wants a band of colour, but it is
// warm-shifted and used once, not as a card background.
//
// A real cover photograph always wins over a tint — the tint is only the
// fallback, never a stock image standing in for goods nobody photographed.
