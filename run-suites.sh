# Why this exists: a hand-rolled `for` loop that greps for a summary line
# silently scores a CRASHED suite as "0 passed / 0 failed". Seven broken
# suites once hid behind a green-looking total that way. This runner treats a
# missing summary as a hard failure, which is what it is.

# discovery.jsx is in ALL because it is a real suite that was silently missing:
# 216 lines and 25 checks, one of them failing, and it appeared in no total this

# cannot fail — the same class of lie as a test that cannot fail.
